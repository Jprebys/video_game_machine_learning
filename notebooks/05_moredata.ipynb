       "The player is depicted as a character on-screen performing at a public location. The words to the song scroll bottom to top at the bottom of the screen, above a piano roll representation of the relative pitches at which they are to be sung (the game calls these \"note tubes\"). At the left end of this area, a \"pitch star\" shows the pitch which the player is singing and provides feedback on whether theyre hitting the notes. A \"crowd meter\" shows the mood of the crowd as the player sings; if they do a good job of hitting notes on-pitch then the crowd will cheer more loudly and clap in rhythm with the song, and the scene will become more vividly animated. If the crowd meter falls all the way to the lowest rating, the audience will boo the character off-stage and the game is over.Each song is divided into approximately 30 to 50 \"phrases\". A meter will fill up and turn from red to green for each phrase, based on how well the player sings the right notes; if the player can fill the meter to green, they will score more points, and getting several greens in a row will create a \"combo\" and award a 2x score multiplier until the player fails to make green on another phrase. This blue meter resembles how long you should hold the note for and at what pitch. The game can be set at higher difficulties which make this meter larger and require the player to hit the right notes more precisely to fill it to green.Since maximum scores for each song are normalized 50,000 regardless of difficulty, overall scores on songs can be compared. To achieve the gold record for a song, 12,500 points must be achieved. To achieve the platinum record for a song, 20,000 points must be achieved. Winning records will unlock additional characters, outfits, and songs. In Karaoke Revolution Party, Karaoke Revolution Country, Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol, and American Idol Encore, 50,000 points (a perfect score) earns a diamond record.  In Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol Encore 2 the point system was changed so that 60,000 points gives a platinum record for a song and 100,000 points is a perfect score (diamond record).Karaoke Revolution Volume 2 introduces a \"medley mode\" which challenges the player to sing a string of short clips from various songs.Karaoke Revolution Volume 3 introduces \"duet mode\" which lets two singers play simultaneously. It also revised scoring so that perfect performances result in exactly 50,000 points (with the exception of the Jackson 5s \"ABC\").Karaoke Revolution Party features minigames, support for the EyeToy camera, and a \"Sing and Dance\" mode which utilizes the dance pad controller.Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol utilizes American Idol judges, commentary, and stages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    13\n",
       "Lego Star Wars IIs gameplay is from a third-person perspective, and takes place in a 3D game world that contains objects, environments, and characters designed to resemble Lego pieces. Its gameplayâ€”a combination of the action-adventure, platform, and sometimes puzzle genresâ€”shares elements with that of Lego Star Wars: The Video Game (2005). While Lego Star Wars followed the events of The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005), Lego Star Wars II is based on Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of the Jedi (1983). The game comically retells the trilogys events using cutscenes without dialogue. The player assumes the roles of the films characters, each of whom possesses specific weapons and abilities. At any time, a second player can join the game, by activating a second controller. During gameplay, players can collect Lego studs â€“ small, disk-shaped objects, which serve as the games currency. The player has a health meter, which is displayed on the games heads-up display. The players health is represented by four hearts; when these hearts are depleted, the player dies, and a small amount of their studs bounce away. However, they instantly respawn and can often re-collect the lost studs.The games central location is the Mos Eisley cantina, a spaceport bar on the planet Tatooine. At the counter, the player may use their Lego studs to purchase characters, vehicles, gameplay hints and extras, or activate cheat codes. In a small area outside the cantina, players may view collected vehicles. The game is broken into levels, which are accessed from the cantina; each film is represented by six levels, representing key locations and scenes in that film. The locations include Hoth, Bespin, Dagobah, Tatooine, the Death Star, and Endor. The game also features bonus levels. During levels, the player defeats enemies, builds objects out of Lego bricks, and drives vehicles. Certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles, including a TIE fighter, a Snowspeeder, and the Millennium Falcon. Levels must first be played in Story Mode. This unlocks the next level as well as a Free Play mode for the recently completed level. Gameplay is identical in the two modes. However, Story Mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on, while Free Play-offers all those unlocked. Levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items.Three types of secret items are available: gold bricks, minikits, and power bricks. Within each level is hidden one power brick. When a power brick is collected, its corresponding extra, such as invincibility or stud multipliers, becomes available for purchase. Each level also contains ten hidden minikits, that is, ten pieces of a Star Wars vehicle. When all ten have been collected, the player is awarded a gold brick. Collecting a certain number of gold bricks unlocks free rewards, such as a spigot that spews out studs. Gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed, and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level; ninety-nine gold bricks are available. The vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina. As each vehicle is completed (all ten minikits collected), it becomes available for play in a bonus level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               8\n",
       "Madden 08 runs at 60 frames per second on the Xbox 360, and 30 frames per second on the PlayStation 3. A new branching animation system allows dynamic gameplay for the first time in the franchise. Players are no longer locked into animations but are now controlled more by the player. Features of the new animation system include mid-air collisions, big-time, one-handed catches, hurdles, sideline catches and gang tackling. Madden 08 brings back some features for its online play; for example, there is the return of Season Mode and tournaments held online. Another updated feature â€“ dubbed Hit Stick 2.0 â€“ allows players to hit high or low by flicking the analog stick up or down. A new fatigue system has been implemented, disallowing users from taking a scrambling quarterback and repeatedly running around behind the line of scrimmage for very long gains. Fatigue also plays a factor when cold-weather teams play in hot weather during the early months of the season. Another feature that returned to this years incarnation is the much sought after \"co-op\" play, which had found itself sitting on the sidelines since making the jump to the next-generation consoles. This mode finds players teaming up with a friend and taking on the CPU or two human opponents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      8\n",

       "Ace Combat 04 takes place in the shared fictional universe wherein most other Ace Combat games take place. A massive asteroid named Ulysses 1994XF04 collided with Earth in a disastrous impact event, killing hundreds of thousands of people. The nations on the continent of Usea had developed an array of anti-asteroid railguns codenamed \"Stonehenge\" to destroy the asteroids fragments, but they could not completely prevent the disaster. Erusea, one of the largest nations and located on the west coast, was shattered economically and chose to close its borders to refugees, leading to heightened tensions with its neighbors. Eruseas military launched a surprise invasion of San Salvacion, its closest neighbor, and captured the Stonehenge railguns to repurpose them as anti-aircraft weapons. War quickly broke out between Erusea and the other Usean nations, who formed a military defense coalition known as the Independent State Allied Forces (ISAF). Using Stonehenge to decimate the ISAFs airpower, Erusea routed their military and occupied key strategic locations on the continent. On the verge of imminent defeat, the ISAFs General Headquarters relocated to the island of North Point off the northeastern coast of the continent, outside of Stonehenges effective radius.Mobius 1 is a fighter pilot serving in the ISAF Air Force in the middle of the war. Mobius 1 and his fellow pilots are dispatched to thwart Eruseas attempts to invade North Point, intercepting a unit of Erusean bombers off the coast while catching another bomber unit on the ground at a nearby airbase. Mobius 1 also takes part in the destruction of a northern Erusean radar installation, allowing surviving ISAF troops to retreat back to North Point. The ISAF Air Force subsequently destroys Eruseas \"invincible\" Aegir Fleet moored at Comberth Harbor, thwarting Eruseas attempt to invade North Point by sea. Bolstered by their stunning victories, the ISAF initiates an airstrike to target Erusean solar panel facilities in the heart of the continent. A surprise attack by Stonehenge inflicts heavy casualties upon the strike force, reminding the ISAF that the weapon still has an iron grip over the skies of the continent.Between missions, a story is told through interlude flashbacks, later revealed to be a long letter to Mobius 1 about the war and living inside Eruseas occupation of San Salvacion. The letter is written by an unnamed man whose parents were killed when an ISAF fighter jet crashed into their house when he was a child. This fighter jet was shot down by Yellow 13, Eruseas top fighter pilot, and a member of the well-known elite Yellow Squadron, who are tasked with defending Stonehenge from air attacks. Following his parents death, the boy is taken in by his uncle, an alcoholic taxi driver who lives in the city above a tavern frequented by Erusean soldiers. While in the tavern, the boy befriends 13 after meeting him and the other Yellow Squadron members. He also learns that the owner of the bar is a member of the local resistance against Erusea and becomes a \"spy\" for them due to his friendship with 13.As the war progresses, Mobius 1s contributions turn the tide as the ISAF begins retaking Usea. The ISAF establishes a foothold on the southern coast of the continent and restarts the ground war. The situation in San Salvacion becomes more desperate as the ISAF draws closer. The interlude narrator recalls one event where the bar owners daughter plants a bomb on Yellow Squadrons airfield, which damages the plane of Yellow 13s wingman, a female pilot known as Yellow 4. The ISAF then attacks Stonehenge itself; Mobius 1 manages to destroy all of the active railguns before Yellow Squadron arrives and attacks Mobius 1, who subsequently shoots down and kills Yellow 4. With Stonehenge out of commission, the ISAF invades the northern coast of Usea and pushes forward into Erusean territory, liberating San Salvacion in the process. The interlude narrator recalls following Yellow Squadron as they retreated to Eruseas capital. After breaking through Eruseas final line of defense, the ISAF invades and captures the capital and Mobius 1 shoots down the entirety of Yellow Squadron, killing Yellow 13 and forcing Erusea to surrender. A group of rogue Erusean officers activate a missile launch facility, codenamed \"Megalith\", that can shoot down asteroid debris stuck in orbit to crash on the continent. The ISAF Air Force is reformed into Mobius Squadron; led by Mobius 1, the squadron shoots down the Erusean defense squadron and Mobius 1 destroys Megalith, putting a final end to the war. The final interlude has the narrator reflecting upon Yellow 13s respect and admiration for Mobius 1 as his opponent, and ends his letter with a request for Mobius 1 to confirm Yellow 13s feelings. The story of Mobius 1 continues in the arcade mode of Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War, where it is revealed that a resistance movement called \"Free Erusea\" has continued to struggle against the ISAF and the new ISAF-backed Erusean government since the wars end. Mobius 1 engages the resistance forces and cuts off their supply lines and destroys Free Eruseas main headquarters, ending the uprising. Mobius 1 fights once more against a resurgence of Free Erusea in the VR mode of Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown, which preludes the main story of Skies Unknown.       1\n",

       "March of the Minis opens with the grand opening for the \"Super Mini-Mario World\" amusement park based on the highly successful mechanical toys developed by the Mini-Mario Toy Company. Immediately following the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Mario presents his VIP guest Pauline with a Mini-Mario toy, while at the same time, Donkey Kong offers her a Mini-Donkey Kong toy. When Pauline chooses the Mini-Mario toy, Donkey Kong becomes infuriated and storms off with her to the roof. Mario, unable to follow, sends the Mini-Mario toys in pursuit to save Pauline.The Mini-Mario toys work their way through eight floors, each with nine challenging rooms, confronting Donkey Kong on each floor. Eventually, Mario and the Mini-Mario toys reach the roof and defeat Donkey Kong. Afterwards, Mario is relieved to find Pauline safe and sound in a small room surrounded by presents and holding a cup of tea. Donkey Kong enters the room, feeling remorse for his behavior, and Pauline picks up a Mini-Donkey Kong toy and kisses it, making Donkey Kong feel better, knowing that she has forgiven him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
       "The narrative of Rez is told without dialogue and using minimal description, relying on in-game visual storytelling. In the future, amid a rising population and an overflowing amount of information corrupting cyberspace, a new network dubbed \"K Project\" is created to manage the data. At the heart of K Project is an artificial intelligence called Eden.

       "Mario and Princess Peach are walking together when lightning suddenly strikes Peachs castle nearby. As Mario runs to investigate, Bowser Jr. appears, sneaking up on the Princess from behind and kidnapping her. Realizing what has happened, Mario quickly rushes back and gives chase. Mario ventures through eight worlds pursuing Bowser Jr. and trying to rescue the kidnapped princess. Mario catches up to them and confronts Bowser Jr. occasionally, but is unable to save the princess from the young Koopas clutches. At the end of the first world, Bowser Jr. retreats to a castle, where his father, Bowser, awaits Mario on a bridge over a pit filled with lava. In a scene highly reminiscent of the original Super Mario Bros., Mario activates a button behind Bowser to defeat him, and the bridge underneath Bowser collapses, causing him to fall into the lava which burns his flesh, leaving a skeleton.Though Bowser was defeated in the first level, this does not stop Bowser Jr. from running through the remaining worlds with Peach in tow, forcing Mario to chase after him before reaching Bowsers castle in world 8. There, Bowser Jr. revives his fathers skeleton, creating Dry Bowser, but Mario once again defeats Bowser by dropping him into a deep pit. In the final battle, Bowser Jr. flees once more across a lava chasm to a larger castle, where he throws his fathers bones into a cauldron and revives Bowser in his original form. They attack Mario in tandem, but Mario drops the pair into the pit below. In the games final sequence, Mario rescues Peach, who kisses him on the cheek. Over the end credits, Bowser Jr. is seen dragging his unconscious father across the floor.
