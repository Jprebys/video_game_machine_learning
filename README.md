# Video Games and Machine Learning

by Jacob Prebys

### Overview

Here is a project where I will use natural language processing and other techniques in an attempt to find predictive features for the critical success of a game. As video games become more expensive to make and require larger teams of developers, it is important to understand what it is that makes a game successful. Here we will take video game review scores and pair them with Wikipedia articles to attempt to find a connection between the features of a game and its reception.

### Critical Reception vs Global Sales

My original idea was to use this modeling to target global sales figures, but I decided to instead focus on critical reception for a few reasons. First, critics review games on the same scale: for the Metacritic data that I gathered these scores range from 0 to 100. This is useful because for different sized game studios, the thresholds for commercial success are very different. Second, there is a clear link between Metacritic score and global sales, which you can see below
