# Video Games and Machine Learning

by Jacob Prebys

### Overview

Here is a project where I will use natural language processing and other techniques in an attempt to find predictive features for the critical success of a game. As video games become more expensive to make and require larger teams of developers, it is important to understand what it is that makes a game successful. Here we will take video game review scores and pair them with Wikipedia articles to attempt to find a connection between the features of a game and its reception.
